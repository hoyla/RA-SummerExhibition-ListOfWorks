- 560 tests total

---

## Phase 17 – AWS deployment & cloud infrastructure ✅

### Storage

- Migrated uploaded Excel files from local Docker volume to **Amazon S3**
- Presigned URLs for upload/download (avoid passing file bytes through the API)
- Configurable bucket name via `S3_BUCKET` / `AWS_REGION` env vars
- Local-disk fallback for development (`STORAGE_BACKEND=local|s3`)

### Compute & networking

- **ECS Fargate** for the FastAPI container — no EC2 management
- **RDS PostgreSQL 16** replacing the Docker Compose Postgres container
- **ALB** (Application Load Balancer) with TLS termination and host-based routing
- Health check endpoint (`/health`) used for ALB target-group probes
- VPC with public/private subnets and security groups

### HTTPS & domains

- ACM certificates for `catalogue.hoy.la` (prod) and `staging-catalogue.hoy.la` (staging)
- HTTPS on port 443 with HTTP→HTTPS redirect
- Host-based routing on ALB for prod and staging
- Staging banner displayed on staging environment

### CI/CD

- **GitHub Actions** pipeline: test → Docker build → push to ECR → deploy to ECS
- Branch-based deployment: non-main branches → staging, main → production
- OIDC federation for keyless AWS authentication from GitHub Actions
- Separate staging and production ECS services
- Alembic migrations run automatically on container startup

### Secrets & configuration

- **AWS Secrets Manager** for `DATABASE_URL` and other secrets
- `.env` file used only for local development

---

## Phase 18 – Cognito authentication & user management ✅

### Authentication

- **Amazon Cognito** user pool replacing single shared API key
- Three-mode auth: Cognito JWT → API key (legacy) → no auth (local dev)
- JWT validation via `python-jose` (signature, expiry, audience, issuer)
- Cognito groups mapped to application roles (admin > editor > viewer)
- `ContextVar`-based request-scoped user context
- Audit log `user_email` column auto-populated from request context
- Alembic migration for new column

### Frontend auth

- Cognito login form (email + password) with `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` flow
- `NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED` challenge handling (force change on first login)
- Token storage in `sessionStorage` with automatic refresh
- Role badge in header (admin=red, editor=blue, viewer=grey)
- Fallback to legacy API key input when Cognito is not configured

### User management (admin panel)

- Backend: `/users` CRUD routes via boto3 Cognito admin APIs
  (list, create, update role, enable/disable, reset password)
- Frontend: Users section in Settings page (admin-only, Cognito-only)
  with user table, create form, role change dropdown, enable/disable toggle,
  password reset
- IAM: `catalogue-cognito-admin` inline policy on ECS task role
- 577 tests total across 24 test files

---

## Future considerations

- Advanced title casing rules (LPG eccentricities)
- Undo / revision history for overrides
- Bulk override import from Excel
- Multi-user conflict resolution (optimistic locking)
- PDF preview generation
- Webhook / notification on import completion

---

## Maintenance & CI health (prioritised)

This project is production-ready in many places; the following maintenance
items are prioritised to improve security, reliability, and developer
experience. They are intentionally practical and scoped so a minor commit can
exercise the GitHub Actions CI pipeline to confirm branch, commit and workflow
health.

**Priority 1 — High**

- **Audit upload filename handling**: ensure uploads are sanitized and
  deterministically prefixed (UUID) to avoid collisions and path traversal.
  Add a unit test and a small route-level test to validate the stored filename.

- **S3 temp-file cleanup**: `S3Storage.full_path()` currently writes a
  temporary file with `delete=False`. Convert to a context-managed pattern or
  document and enforce cleanup by callers to avoid temp-file accumulation.

**Priority 2 — Medium**

- **Price parsing precision**: keep `Decimal` precision in `parse_price()` so
  cents/decimals are preserved across normalisation and rendering. Update
  formatting in the renderer and tests accordingly.

- **Alembic migrations gating**: running Alembic during module import can
  surprise interactive tooling. Consider moving automatic `upgrade` to a
  startup event or gating it behind an env var like `RUN_MIGRATIONS=true`.

- **Frontend modularity**: consider splitting `frontend/app.js` into modules or
  adding a minimal bundler step to improve maintainability and enable source
  maps.

**Priority 3 — Low**

- **Tagged Text header consistency**: standardise the ASCII/MAC header emission
  between LoW and Index renderers.

- **JWKS caching resilience**: add a TTL or refresh-on-failure strategy for
  Cognito JWKS to handle key rotation without requiring a container restart.

- **Request tracing**: add request-id propagation (X-Request-Id) to logs for
  easier troubleshooting across services.

**CI smoke-test (branch/commit/workflow verification)**

To confirm GitHub Actions and branch-based deployment behave as expected,
create a small documentation commit on a non-main branch (this should trigger
CI and a staging deployment according to the repo's workflow):

1. Create and switch to a branch:

```bash
git checkout -b docs/ci-smoke-test
```

2. Commit the documentation change (already present locally) and push:

```bash
git add docs/roadmap.md
git commit -m "docs: add maintenance & CI health checklist"
git push -u origin docs/ci-smoke-test
```

3. Observe GitHub Actions for the branch — the CI should run tests, linters,
   and (if configured) deploy to staging. Merge to `main` only after CI
   completes successfully.

If you want, I can create the branch and commit locally for you and either
attempt to push (if you want me to), or provide the exact commands to run on
your machine. Running the minor commit is a quick way to validate that the
workflows trigger and the pipeline is healthy.
